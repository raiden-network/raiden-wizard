# Quick Installer for the Raiden Client
The Raiden installer is a web-based installation wizard which provides quick and easy set up of a Raiden node and access to the Raiden WebUI.

In addition to downloading the latest version of Raiden the installer also takes care of creating a keystore and funding your account with ETH as well as minting the necessary tokens for successfully interacting with Raiden.

## How It Works
### Prerequisites
You'll need to provide the installer with a Infura Project ID. If you don't already have a Project ID simply follow these steps to get one:
* Visit [infura.io](https://infura.io/) and click to sign up for a new account.
* Once you've accessed your account, choose to create a new project.
* Now, view your project and you'll find the Project ID under the __KEYS__ section.
